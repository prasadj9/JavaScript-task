TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, allowing developers to define variable types, 
function arguments, and return types. Developed by Microsoft, TypeScript compiles into plain JavaScript, 
ensuring compatibility with existing JavaScript environments.

Key features include:
Static Typing: Helps catch errors during development by enforcing type constraints.
Interfaces: Define object shapes and structures.
Generics: Allow the creation of reusable, type-safe components.
Classes & Inheritance: Enhanced object-oriented programming support.
Enums & Type Aliases: Simplify complex data structures.

TypeScript improves code quality and maintainability, particularly in large projects, by detecting 
errors early and offering better tooling support (e.g., autocompletion, error checking). However, 
it requires a compilation step and has a learning curve for developers unfamiliar with typed languages.
In summary, TypeScript is a valuable tool for building scalable, maintainable applications while retaining
 full compatibility with JavaScript.
