    <h2>Events</h2>
    <p>
      An event is an action that occurs as per the user's instruction as input
      and gives the output in response. We can consider different types of
      inputs, such as mouse clicks, button presses.

    <p>
      Event bubbling is the default behavior in which an event originating from
      the innermost element propagates up through its ancestors in the DOM
      hierarchy. This means that when an event occurs on a nested element, such
      as a button inside a div, the event is first handled by the innermost
      element and then bubbles up through its ancestors. Eventually, the event
      reaches the root of the DOM (usually the window object).
